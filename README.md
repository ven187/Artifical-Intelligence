# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

This repository contains various algorithms and applications developed in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The original algorithms I have worked on, along with selected examples from deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and data analytics, are presented as a comprehensive reference resource for researchers and developers. Each of the projects demonstrates how theoretical concepts can be integrated with practical applications.
